# User Guide

Welcome to the PyAutomation User Guide. This comprehensive manual is designed to assist you in effectively navigating and utilizing the PyAutomation platform for industrial automation and control.

PyAutomation is a modular tool designed to streamline the management of industrial systems through its core components: **Tags**, **Communications**, **Database**, and **Alarms**.

## Objective

The goal of this manual is to empower operators and engineers to maximize the potential of PyAutomation. By following these guides, you will be able to set up a reliable, efficient, and secure automation environment. Each section includes detailed instructions and visual aids to facilitate the learning process.

## Modules Overview

### [Tags Module](Tags/index.md)

The **Tags Module** acts as the central nervous system of your automation project. It allows you to create, configure, and manage data points (tags) that represent real-world variables such as sensors, actuators, and control parameters. This section covers tag creation, property configuration, and lifecycle management.

### [Communications Module](Communications/index.md)

The **Communications Module** handles external connectivity, specifically focusing on OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) server management. This section guides you through configuring OPC UA servers to ensure seamless interoperability between PyAutomation and other industrial devices or SCADA systems.

### [Database Module](Database/index.md)

The **Database Module** manages the persistence of historical data. It enables connection to various database systems for logging tag values, alarms, and events. This section explains how to configure database connections, ensuring data integrity and availability for trend analysis and auditing.

### [Alarms Module](Alarms/index.md)

The **Alarms Module** provides robust fault detection and notification capabilities. It allows you to define alarm conditions based on tag values, configure thresholds, and manage alarm states (acknowledgment, shelving, suppression). This section details the process of setting up and managing alarms to maintain operational safety.
