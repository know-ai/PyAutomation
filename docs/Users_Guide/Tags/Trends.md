# Trending and Visualization

The **Trends** feature provides a visual representation of tag data over time. This tool is essential for analyzing process behavior, identifying anomalies, and verifying the performance of connected devices.

## Overview

The Trends interface displays a time-series graph for selected tags. It is particularly useful for:
*   **Monitoring**: Real-time observation of critical process variables.
*   **Analysis**: Historical review of data to identify patterns or faults.
*   **Verification**: Checking the stability and responsiveness of OPC UA inputs.
