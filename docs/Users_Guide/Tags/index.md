# Tags Module

The **Tags Module** is the foundational component of PyAutomation, responsible for the definition and management of process variables. A "Tag" serves as a digital representation of a physical input, output, or internal calculation within the automation system.

This module facilitates the seamless exchange of information between different system components, linking the Data Acquisition (DAQ) layer with the User Interface (UI) and the Database.

## Key Features

*   **Tag Management**: Create, update, and delete tags dynamically.
*   **Type Support**: Support for various data types including floating-point numbers, integers, booleans, and strings.
*   **Engineering Units**: Define and convert between different engineering units (e.g., pressure, flow, temperature).
*   **OPC UA Integration**: Map tags directly to OPC UA nodes for external access.
*   **Deadband Filtering**: optimize data logging and transmission by ignoring insignificant value changes.
*   **Trending**: Visualize tag behavior over time.

In the following sections, you will find detailed guides on how to perform specific operations within the Tags Module.
