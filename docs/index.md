# Welcome to PyAutomation

**PyAutomation** is a comprehensive Python framework designed for Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Automation projects. It empowers developers to build scalable, concurrent, and robust industrial applications by combining the flexibility of Python with standard industrial protocols.

## What is PyAutomation?

PyAutomation serves as a bridge between the Operational Technology (OT) world and Information Technology (IT). It allows you to:

- **Connect** to industrial hardware (PLCs, Sensors, RTUs) via protocols like OPC UA.
- **Process** data in real-time using efficient state machines and in-memory databases (CVT).
- **Store** historical data for analysis, compliance, and trending.
- **Visualize** your process using modern web technologies (Dash, Socket.IO).
- **Monitor** critical events with a sophisticated Alarm Management system.

## Key Capabilities

- **Concurrency**: Run multiple control loops and monitoring tasks in parallel without blocking the main application.
- **State Machine Framework**: Define complex logic using finite state machines, perfect for sequential control and process management.
- **Real-Time Data**: A Current Value Table (CVT) ensures that the latest data is always available to all parts of your application.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allows you to plug in new drivers, loggers, or custom logic easily.

## Getting Started

If you are new to PyAutomation, we recommend starting with the [Setup](setup.md) guide to get your environment ready. Then, explore the **User's Guide** to understand the core concepts like Tags, Alarms, and Database management.

For developers looking to extend the framework or build custom logic, the **Developer's Guide** provides in-depth API documentation and architectural details.
